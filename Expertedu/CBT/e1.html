<h3>1. Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.</h3><br>
Delinquency describes actions that would not be crimes if performed by adults. If a young
person performs one of such actions then he or she has committed a crime. Delinquency is one of
several status offences – offences that can be committed only by people in particular stations of
life as determined by age, profession or a person’s role in society. For young people such
offences include drinking, driving and smoking under age. Usually they are offences only to the
extent that they help preserve some of the good things of life for the exclusive enjoyment of the
adult world. Delinquency is therefore a weapon forged in adult minds and directed by adult
hands against young people. It is born out of envy, adult pride and intolerance. If the world
changed overnight and the responsibility to make and enforce laws fell on juvenile shoulders, the
adults should expect a raw deal in return. Delinquency would then certainly refer only to many
of the adult actions now freely committed by them.</p>
